# Background
The naming, Perf Neon, is inspired by a Linux Distribution called KDE Neon, where KDE take latest Ubuntu LTS as a base system and then put Latest KDE on top of it. Same thing as Perf Neon, where i take whatever the world the LineageOS team put under their kernel source and then put minimal patches on top of it.

# What is it for?
While it's mostly used for another kernel developers to compare their work with a literal close-to-stock kernel, it's also fulfill the dream of a purists, where they want everything stable but also wanted extra spices on top of it.
